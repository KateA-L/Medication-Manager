The GitHub repository for my Year 1 Project - MyMed Medication Manager.

As someone who takes multiple medications daily, I have personally experienced the challenges of keeping track of schedules and prescription refills. Coordinating medicines that need to be taken at specific times is particularly challenging, and running out of medication not only creates frustration but can also lead to dangerous withdrawal symptoms. This is one of the primary reasons I chose to undertake this project over others. 

This SPA addresses these issues by empowering users to manage their medication independently and reliably. Unlike existing solutions, which are predominantly mobile apps, this web-based application will be lightweight and easily accessible to a broader audience. While mobile apps certainly have their benefits, my primary goal is to deliver a streamlined, easily accessible medication manager for a broad audience. This also means that I donâ€™t need to worry about advanced offline functionality or integration with mobile hardware. Looking forward, it is entirely possible that this idea could get transformed into a mobile app if and when it grows in complexity and demands more advanced features. 

The SPA has been developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
